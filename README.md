## Synopsis

ByteCode caches all of the links and resources all over the internet under one roof. It is a customizable platform for learners to share and rate resources for computer sciences and programming.

## Code Example

HTML Pages implementing functions should have a PHP File that contains Scripts, links can be found inside the HTML code.

## Motivation

ByteCode was created because there are a ton of resources to learn online but learners often get confused because of lack of credebility to these sources, we place that in the hands of the community, other users can add or rate the resource based on their learning experience.

## Installation

I use the xampp-server to host on local network.
After cloning the repository place the folder in the 'htdocs' folder of your xampp-server and after runnning modules from the xampp control panel, access ByteCode using the browser on 'localhost:80' or '127.0.0.1:80' on the same machine running the xampp-server or if you want to access it on the local network from some other machine, use the IP Address of the host machine with port as 80.
